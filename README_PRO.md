> Like an intern that shadows you, learns your workflows, and executes them perfectly with different parameters.

## 🎯 The Vision

Current AI assistants can't learn from demonstration. You tell them what to do every single time, in detail. There's no memory, no learning, no improvement.

**AgentFlow PRO changes this.**

### The Workflow

```
1. RECORD  →  You perform a task naturally (open Canvas, click your ML class, download notes)
2. LEARN   →  AI watches, extracts UI elements, identifies parameters automatically  
3. EXECUTE →  Tell it "do this for DataVis" → it adapts and executes perfectly
```

### Real-World Impact

- **911 Dispatch**: Learn incident handling once, apply to thousands of calls
- **Customer Support**: Record ticket resolution, execute for similar tickets
- **Healthcare**: Learn chart documentation, apply consistently across patients
- **Education**: Record grading workflow, apply to all student submissions

## ✨ Key Innovations

### 🎥 1. Rich Visual Context Extraction
- Real-time OCR during recording (not post-processing)
- Identifies UI elements: buttons, links, inputs
- Creates visual signatures for robust matching
- Captures element relationships and context

### 🧠 2. Semantic Workflow Matching
- Uses sentence transformers for intelligent intent understanding
- Goes beyond keywords: "Open ML class" matches "Navigate to Machine Learning course"
- Confidence scoring with fallback strategies
- Multi-modal matching (text + visual + structural)

### 🎯 3. Automatic Parameter Detection
- Analyzes workflows in real-time to identify variables
- Distinguishes "Machine Learning" (parameter) from "Submit" (fixed)
- No manual annotation required
- Context-aware parameter classification

### 🔄 4. Multi-Strategy Element Location
```
Strategy 1: OCR text matching (fuzzy search)
   ↓ (if fails)
Strategy 2: Vision LLM semantic understanding
   ↓ (if fails)  
Strategy 3: Position heuristics (fallback)
```

### 💪 5. Robust Execution Engine
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Intelligent failure recovery (scroll, wait, relax thresholds)
- State verification after each action
- Detailed execution reporting and analytics

## 📊 Features in Detail

### Recording Mode

```python
from enhanced_recorder import EnhancedWorkflowRecorder

recorder = EnhancedWorkflowRecorder()

# Start recording
workflow_id = recorder.start_recording(
    workflow_name="My Workflow",
    description="What it does",
    tags=["productivity", "automation"]
)

# User performs actions...
# System captures:
# - Screenshots before/after each action
# - OCR text extraction
# - UI element identification
# - Visual signatures
# - Parameter detection

# Stop and analyze
workflow_id = recorder.stop_recording()
# Output: Parameters detected automatically!
```

### Semantic Matching

```python
from enhanced_context_system import SemanticWorkflowMatcher

matcher = SemanticWorkflowMatcher(context_extractor)

# Find best match for user request
workflow, confidence, params = matcher.find_best_match(
    user_request="Download notes from my DataVis class",
    workflows=learned_workflows
)

# Returns:
# workflow: "Open Canvas Class and Download Notes"
# confidence: 0.89
# params: {"class_name": "DataVis"}
```

### Robust Execution

```python
from robust_executor import RobustWorkflowExecutor

executor = RobustWorkflowExecutor()

success, results = executor.execute_workflow(
    workflow=workflow,
    parameters={"class_name": "DataVis"},
    verbose=True
)

# Execution log shows:
# - Which strategy found each element (OCR/Vision/Position)
# - Retry attempts
# - Confidence scores
# - Execution time
```

### Workflow Composition

```python
from workflow_composition import WorkflowComposer, CompositionStep

composer = WorkflowComposer()

# Chain multiple workflows
composition_id = composer.create_composition(
    name="Download from All Classes",
    description="Download notes from ML, DataVis, and DataMining",
    steps=[
        CompositionStep(
            workflow_id=open_class_workflow,
            parameters={"class_name": "Machine Learning"}
        ),
        CompositionStep(
            workflow_id=download_workflow,
            parameters={}
        ),
        CompositionStep(
            workflow_id=open_class_workflow,
            parameters={"class_name": "DataVis"}
        ),
        CompositionStep(
            workflow_id=download_workflow,
            parameters={}
        )
    ]
)

# Execute the composition
composer.execute_composition(composition_id, executor)
```
