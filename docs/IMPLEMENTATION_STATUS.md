## üöß In Progress / TODO

### Visual-Guided Execution ‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY
The core execution engine that replays workflows is **stubbed but not fully implemented**.

**What's needed:**
1. **Element Location Algorithm**
   - Use OCR to find target text in screenshot
   - Use visual signatures to match elements
   - Use Vision LLM as fallback
   - Implement sliding window search
   - Handle partial matches and fuzzy matching

2. **Coordinate Translation**
   - Map recorded coordinates to current screen
   - Handle different screen sizes
   - Account for UI scaling
   - Normalize positions

3. **Action Execution Loop**
   - For each step in workflow:
     - Take screenshot
     - Locate target element with new parameters
     - Calculate click coordinates
     - Execute action
     - Wait for UI response
     - Verify state change
     - Retry if failed

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Fallback strategies when element not found
   - User intervention prompts
   - State recovery after errors

5. **State Verification**
   - Compare screenshot after action to expected
   - Use visual hashing to detect changes
   - Verify text content appeared/disappeared
   - Wait for loading indicators

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days

### Enhanced Visual Matching
- [ ] Template matching with OpenCV
- [ ] CLIP embeddings for semantic matching
- [ ] Visual element database/index
- [ ] Multi-strategy fusion (combine OCR + vision + template)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Conditional logic in workflows (if-then-else)
- [ ] Loop detection and extraction
- [ ] Multi-step parameter dependencies
- [ ] Workflow composition (combine workflows)
- [ ] Real-time workflow editing

### Robustness Improvements
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] Progress indicators during execution
- [ ] Workflow validation before execution
- [ ] Dry-run mode (show what would happen)
- [ ] Undo/redo during recording

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Lazy loading of screenshots
- [ ] Compressed storage format
- [ ] Parallel OCR processing
- [ ] Caching of visual signatures
- [ ] Fast workflow indexing with FAISS

### Cross-Platform Support
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] Linux support
- [ ] Browser extension for better web control
- [ ] Mobile device mirroring support

### UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] Web-based UI for workflow management
- [ ] Visual workflow editor
- [ ] Real-time execution preview
- [ ] Workflow debugging tools
- [ ] Parameter validation UI

## üéØ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Complete Visual-Guided Execution (HIGH PRIORITY)
This is the **critical missing piece**. Without it, we can record workflows but not replay them with new parameters.

**Steps:**
1. Implement basic element location with OCR
2. Add coordinate calculation and action execution
3. Implement retry logic
4. Add state verification
5. Test with recorded workflows

### 2. Improve Visual Matching (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Current matching is basic. Need more robust strategies:
1. Add template matching with OpenCV
2. Implement fuzzy visual matching
3. Add Vision LLM element location
4. Combine multiple strategies

### 3. Add Workflow Editing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Allow users to edit recorded workflows:
1. Manual step insertion/deletion
2. Parameter annotation
3. Add conditional logic
4. Test individual steps

### 4. Enhance Error Handling (LOW PRIORITY)
Better error messages and recovery:
1. Detailed error logging
2. User-friendly error messages
3. Recovery suggestions
4. Automatic issue reporting

### 5. Performance Optimization (LOW PRIORITY)
Once basic functionality works:
1. Profile and optimize bottlenecks
2. Add caching
3. Implement parallel processing
4. Optimize storage

## üß™ Testing Status

### Manual Testing
- [x] Workflow recording works
- [x] Screenshots captured correctly
- [x] OCR extracts text
- [x] Parameters identified by LLM
- [x] Workflows saved to disk
- [x] Workflow listing and search
- [ ] Visual-guided execution (not tested - not implemented)

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Visual memory tests
- [ ] Recorder tests
- [ ] Visual analyzer tests
- [ ] Workflow matching tests
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests

### Known Issues
1. **OCR sometimes misses text** - Need better preprocessing
2. **Recording can be slow** - Screenshot capture takes time
3. **Parameter identification not always accurate** - LLM prompt needs tuning
4. **No progress indicator during recording** - User doesn't know if it's working
5. **Execution not implemented** - Can record but not replay
