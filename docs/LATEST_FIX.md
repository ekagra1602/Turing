# Latest Fix - Threading Issue Resolved

## Problem

The app was crashing with:
```
NSWindow should only be instantiated on the main thread!
```

## Cause

The visual feedback system (green circles) was trying to create Tkinter windows from a background thread, which macOS doesn't allow when the main thread already has a Tkinter GUI (the overlay).

## Solution

Replaced the fancy visual feedback with a **simpler, better approach**:

Instead of creating indicator windows, the playback now:
1. **Moves the mouse** to each click position (0.3 second animation)
2. **Pauses** for 0.2 seconds so you can see where it is
3. **Clicks** at that position

### Benefits of This Approach:

‚úÖ **Thread-safe** - No Tkinter threading issues
‚úÖ **More visual** - You actually see the mouse move to each position
‚úÖ **Simpler** - Less code, more reliable
‚úÖ **Better UX** - You can follow along as it runs

## What You'll See Now

When playing back a recording:

```
[1/5] Clicking at (20, 594) [calibrated]
```

The mouse will:
1. **Smoothly move** to position (20, 594)
2. **Pause briefly**
3. **Click**
4. Move to next position...

You can **watch the mouse** move through all your recorded actions!

## Try It Again

```bash
./start_overlay.sh
```

- Click **üìÅ Load** to load your recording
- Click **‚ñ∂ Play**
- **Watch the mouse** move and click automatically
- Should work without crashes now!

## Note About Calibration

The output shows `[calibrated]` which means calibration.json was found and applied. The click at (20, 594) is the **corrected** coordinate after applying the calibration offset.

If clicks are still in the wrong place, you may need to run calibration:

```bash
./venv_gui/bin/python calibrate.py
```

But the crashes are fixed! ‚úÖ
